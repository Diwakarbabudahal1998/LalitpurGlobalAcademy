                <p>Achievements - applauds, opportunities - thoughts, this is what I gained from Lalitpur Global Academy. LGA gave me a platform that I always will be cherishing.
                    I joined the school at class 7<sup>th</sup>. I still remember my first there. I found myself among some of the best teachers and classmates. As a newcomer, I had this mission of proving myself. There were hurdles in my path but at the same time guidance of some of the excellent mentors made my journey all more exciting, smooth and fulfilling. I definitely wasn't the best in my class but it was motivation, guidance and most importantly consistent efforts that helped me improve. Someday I won and somedays I learnt.
                    It was during those days that my personality was moulded in the gracious hands of my teachers. I appreciate everything that LGA has done for me by providing many learning opportunities and making me become the person who I am today. To all the worthy teachers who treated me not as a student but a child as their own, I will always owe them.
                    I would confidently say that LGA is a place where hard work really counts. If you give your best, nothing can really challenge your path to desired success!
